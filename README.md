> A hands-on project that brings theory to life: dynamic delta hedging of a European call option using the Black-Scholes model and geometric Brownian motion â€” entirely built in R and Shiny.

---

## What It Does

This interactive app simulates a **delta-hedged trading strategy**.  
It tracks the performance of a portfolio hedging a European call option in real time and visualizes:

- The option price over time (via Black-Scholes)
- The value of the dynamically hedged portfolio
- The **hedging error** from rebalancing daily

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. Simulate a stock price path using **Geometric Brownian Motion**
2. Calculate the **Black-Scholes option price** and **delta** every day
3. Adjust the portfolio by:
   - Buying or selling delta shares
   - Updating the cash position (interest-bearing)
4. Plot:
   - **Delta Hedging Error**
   - ðŸ“Š **Portfolio vs Option Price**
